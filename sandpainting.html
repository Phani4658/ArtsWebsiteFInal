      <p>
        Sandpainting is the art of pouring colored sands, powdered pigments from
        minerals or crystals, and pigments from other natural or synthetic
        sources onto a surface to make a fixed, or unfixed sand painting.
        Unfixed sand paintings have a long established cultural history in
        numerous social groupings around the globe, and are often temporary,
        ritual paintings prepared for religious or healing ceremonies. It is
        also referred to as drypainting.

        With a huge surge of interest in craft subjects having a serious
        environmental slant and a spate of craft magazines encouraging readers
        to try it for themselves, permanent sand painting skills have improved
        dramatically the quality and variety of work available in this medium
        and has resulted in its being included on the recently created
        'Wikicollecting' site. The environmental aspects of a craft with which
        one can compose such quirky creations have much to commend them to a
        wider, more appreciative audience, and with the exception of the
        nontoxic adhesives used, all the work shown below consists of re-cycled
        and found materials and no preparatory drawing is made. Dry naturally
        occurring oxidised and mineral-charged coloured sands, perhaps with the
        addition of powdered charcoal to widen the palette, are sprinkled
        through a sieve or 'drawn' with a paper funnel onto the area of the
        picture being worked on, and then blended in - either with a discarded
        feather 'brush' or gently blown into position with a drinking straw
        before being permanently fixed to a plywood offcut which is used as a
        'canvas'. Having been allowed to dry, the sand painter moves on to the
        next section of the picture. Any minor adjustments or snags are sorted
        before the work is given a final coat of varnish which intensifies the
        depth of colour but without the disadvantage of surface reflection which
        occurs in the case of many oil paintings.
