        Oil painting is the process of painting withpigments with a medium of
        drying oil as thebinder. It has been the most common technique for
        artistic painting on wood panel or canvas for several centuries,
        spreading from Europe to the rest of the world. The advantages of oil
        for painting images include "greater flexibility, richer and denser
        colour, the use of layers, and a wider range from light to dark".[1] But
        the process is slower, especially when one layer of paint needs to be
        allowed to dry before another is applied.

        The oldest known oil paintings were created by Buddhist artists in
        Afghanistan and date back to the 7th century AD. The technique of
        binding pigments in oil was later brought to Europe in the 15th century,
        about 900 years later. The adoption of oil paint by Europeans began with
        Early Netherlandish painting in Northern Europe, and by the height of
        the Renaissance, oil painting techniques had almost completely replaced
        the use of tempera paints in the majority of Europe. Oil paint was used
        by Europeans for painting statues and woodwork from at least the 12th
        century, but its common use for painted images began with Early
        Netherlandish painting in Northern Europe, and by the height of the
        Renaissance, oil painting techniques had almost completely replaced the
        use of egg tempera paints for panel paintings in most of Europe, though
        not for Orthodox icons or wall paintings, where tempera and fresco,
        respectively, remained the usual choice.
